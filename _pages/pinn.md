## Description

Neural networks are the primary type of models used in deep learning and modern artificial intelligence. These models, especially those with more modern architectures, have been applied to several applications with great success. In this project, students will investigate different neural network architectures, their properties as well as their empirical performance. They will have opportunities to work with real-world large scale data sets and state-of-the-art neural network models. Depending on the studentâ€™s interest, the project could also be theoretical where the focus will be on analysing theoretical properties of neural networks.
