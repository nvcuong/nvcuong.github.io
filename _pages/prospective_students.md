Before contacting me for a potential PhD application, please look at my research interests below to see if you want to work on one of them:

- Bayesian methods for ML (see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10628){:target="_blank"} or [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07131){:target="_blank"})
- Intersection between ML and statistics (see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.22065){:target="_blank"})
- Mathematical theory for ML (see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.22065){:target="_blank"} or [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.2714){:target="_blank"})
- Transferability estimation and applications (see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.12462){:target="_blank"} or [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00656){:target="_blank"})

You also need to ensure you meet the following criteria:

- First class honours (or high 2.1 at undergraduate or Masters) degree in Maths, Physics, Computer Science, or related subjects. This is equivalent to GPA 3.3+ for international degrees.
- Strong background in mathematics.
- Strong programming skills in a high-level language such as Python, C/C++, or R.
- Meeting the [English language requirements of Durham University](https://www.dur.ac.uk/study/international/entry-requirements/english-language-requirements/){:target="_blank"}.

Then please send an email to me that includes the following information:

- A short statement (maximum 500 words) on:

    1. Potential research problems that you want to work on;
    2. Why you feel PhD research is for you;
    3. Your plan to secure funding for your full-time PhD research (Please note that scholarships from Durham are available but very competitive).

- Your up-to-date CV.
- Your degree transcripts.
