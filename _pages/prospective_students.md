Before contacting me for a potential PhD application, please look at my research interests below to see if you want to work on one of them:
- Bayesian methods for ML (see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10628){:target="_blank"} or [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07131){:target="_blank"});
- Intersection of ML and statistics (see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.22065){:target="_blank"});
- Mathematical theory for ML (see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.22065){:target="_blank"} or [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.2714){:target="_blank"});
- Transferability estimation and applications (see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.12462){:target="_blank"} or [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00656){:target="_blank"}).

You also need to ensure you meet the following criteria:
- First class honours or equivalent degree (such as GPA 3.3+ for international degrees) in Maths, Physics, Computer Science, or related subjects;
- Strong background in mathematics;
- Strong programming skills in a high-level language such as Python, C/C++, or R;
- Meeting the [English language requirements](https://www.dur.ac.uk/study/international/entry-requirements/english-language-requirements/){:target="_blank"}.

Then please send an email to me that includes the following information:

1. A short statement (maximum 500 words) on:
    - Potential research problems that you want to work on;
    - Why you feel PhD research is for you;
    - Your plan to secure funding for your PhD research (Please note that scholarships from Durham are available but very competitive).
2. Your up-to-date CV.
3. All your degree transcripts.

Please also see [Apply for a Research Degree in Mathematical Sciences](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/mathematical-sciences/postgraduate-study/research-degrees/apply/){:target="_blank"} for additional information on how to apply to our Statistics group.
