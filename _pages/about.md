I am an Assistant Professor in Statistics at the Department of Mathematical Sciences, Durham University, working on statistical machine learning. Before joining Durham, I was a faculty member at Florida International University from 2021--2023, an Applied Scientist at Amazon Web Services from 2018--2021, a postdoc at Cambridge University from 2016--2018 and at the National University of Singapore from 2015--2016. I received Bachelor and PhD degrees in Computer Science from the National University of Singapore in 2010 and 2015 respectively. I regularly serves as a reviewer for top-tier conferences and journals such as NeurIPS, ICML, JMLR, and TPAMI. I was a senior program committee member for AAAI 2022 as well as an area chair for ECCV 2022 and CVPR 2024.
