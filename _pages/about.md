I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon Web Services (AWS). Before joining AWS, I was a postdoc at Cambridge University (working with [Richard Turner](http://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/Turner)) and the National University of Singapore (working with [Huan Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7vLwm84AAAAJ&hl=en)). I received BComp and PhD degrees in Computer Science both from the National University of Singapore. My PhD thesis advisor was [Lee Wee Sun](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leews/). 

My research interests are in machine learning and Bayesian statistics.
