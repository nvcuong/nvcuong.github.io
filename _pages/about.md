I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the Knight Foundation School of Computing and Information Sciences, Florida International University, leading a research group on **machine learning** and **artificial intelligence**. Before joining FIU, I was an Applied Scientist at Amazon Web Services from 2018--2021, a postdoc at Cambridge University from 2016--2018 and at the National University of Singapore from 2015--2016. I received Bachelor and PhD degrees in Computer Science from the National University of Singapore in 2010 and 2015 respectively. I regularly serves as a reviewer for top-tier conferences and journals such as NeurIPS, ICML, JMLR, and TPAMI. I was a senior program committee member for AAAI 2022 and an area chair for ECCV 2022.
