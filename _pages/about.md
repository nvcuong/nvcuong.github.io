I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon Web Services (AWS). Before joining AWS, I was a postdoc at the [Machine Learning group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/), Cambridge University, working with [Richard Turner](http://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/Turner)). Before that, I was a postdoc at the National University of Singapore, working with [Huan Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7vLwm84AAAAJ&hl=en). I received the Bachelor and PhD degrees in Computer Science from the School of Computing, National University of Singapore. My PhD thesis advisor is [Lee Wee Sun](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leews/).

My research interests are in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
