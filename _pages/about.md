I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon Web Services (AWS). Before joining AWS, I was a postdoc at Cambridge University (working with Richard Turner) and the National University of Singapore (working with Huan Xu). I received BComp and PhD degrees in Computer Science both from the National University of Singapore. My PhD thesis advisor was Lee Wee Sun. My research interests are in machine learning and Bayesian statistics.
