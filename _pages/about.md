I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the [Knight Foundation School of Computing and Information Sciences](https://www.cis.fiu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, [Florida International University](https://www.fiu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, working in the areas of **machine learning** and **artificial intelligence**. Before joining FIU, I was an Applied Scientist at Amazon Web Services from 2018--2021, a postdoc at Cambridge University from 2016--2018, and a postdoc at the National University of Singapore from 2015--2016. I received Bachelor and PhD degrees in Computer Science from the National University of Singapore in 2010 and 2015 respectively. I regularly serves as a reviewer for top-tier conferences and journals such as NeurIPS, ICML, JMLR, and TPAMI. I was a senior program committee member for AAAI 2022 and an area chair for ECCV 2022.

**Working with me:** If you are an FIU student interested in doing research with me, please drop me an email. If you are an international student, please apply directly to the [FIU PhD program in Computer Science](https://www.cis.fiu.edu/academics/degrees/graduate/doctor-of-philosophy-in-computer-science/).
